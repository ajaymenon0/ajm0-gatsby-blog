It has been over a couple of years since I've maintained a personal blog as such.
The direct effect of which clearly has been the fact that I've been writing way less. Like waaaaaayyyy less. Like Planck Length amounts. ðŸ¤“

I used to maintain a personal blog called **Eat Prey Shove** back from 2014 to 2016 but that just lost steam somewhere at the half way mark. I never felt inspired to bring it back.

I did start writing for a medium publication called [The Unprofessionals](https://unprofession.com/@ajaymenon), I still do. But I can't get super personal there since at the end of the day, it is an article *meant* for a publication. I need a place where I can at least park all my raw ideas at. Might be fully resolved ideas or just streams of consciousness floating on to ink/pixels.

After spending almost 6 years in Bombay and now that I've come close to completing 2 years in Bangalore, it seems a lot of my ideologies and values have been thrown around and shaken up to give birth to newer things. A lot might have to do with hitting 30, but lets not dwell on that too much now.

I plan to write about Language, Productivity, Music, Programming, Consciousness, Programming Consciousness, Philosophy, Social Media... all of which might have the proclivity of boiling down to a compilation of memes and GIFs. But as everyone knows or will soon know, there's a ginormous ravine between planning and execution.

All I can say now is that good to be back.
